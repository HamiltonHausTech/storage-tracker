# Storage Bin Tracker Roadmap

## Before Public Release
- [ ] Fuzzy search / partial matches
- [✅] Backup `bins.json` before every save (already done ✅)
- [ ] Sort bins/items alphabetically when listing
- [✅] Friendly prompts and confirmations for deletes/overwrites
- [✅] Clean up CLI messaging (errors/success formatting)

## Future Ideas
- [ ] Optional GUI version (Tkinter or Flask)
- [ ] QR code generation for bins
- [ ] Cloud sync (Dropbox / Google Drive)
- [ ] Basic mobile-friendly UI
